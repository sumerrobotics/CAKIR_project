    "Main design purpose of the robot is, to search living beings and define their location inside the disastrous places as short as possible. In order to achieve this, main design criteria have to be considered as given below:\n",

    "**1.** Flexible robotics design to enter any point as much as possible inside the debris <br>\n",
    "**2.** Image and sound processing methods for object detection <br>\n",
